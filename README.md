# DigiLab - DemoSiteNorway DSN

## Project Description

In the most general terms, the **DigiLab** project aims to create a digital platform which will allow students and the general public to learn how to create, use and learn from digital twins. The purpose is therefore to teach the concept of Digital Twins, to teach how to build them and, at the same time, to turn them into Digital or Virtual Laboratories where creativity can be applied to the generation of new content and ways of teaching.

**DemoSiteSpain** serves as a specific repository within the DigiLab project. In this DemoSite, four Arduino boards have been strategically placed in different classrooms within Segura Valley High School. Each Arduino board is equipped with a diverse array of sensors.

## Folder Structure

- **DemoSiteNorway Repository**: This repository is dedicated to the Demo Site developed in Norway.
